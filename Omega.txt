Omega is a game written by Laurence Brothers in the late 1980s for Unix
workstations. It derives principally from the tradition of earlier games
such as Rogue and Hack, where the player explores a labyrinth of
dungeons and monsters through the medium of an ASCII map display.

Omega is interesting as it was one of the first such games to show the
influence of more story and quest led games, particularly the Ultima
series that were released commercially by Origin Systems for various
micros during the 1980s. Rather than simply wandering round a dungeon,
in Omega the player has various paths open to them to appease the gods
of Omega's world.

I've taken Omega 0.80.2 and built it as a "proper" Windows application
(rather than the console mode builds that have been available before).
This version can also optionally show the area around the player using
graphics, rather than the usual ASCII characters. The graphics come from
David Gervais' tiles, drawn originally for the game Angband.
